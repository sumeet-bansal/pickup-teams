### Summary
**Problem to Solve**  
Undergraduate computer scientists typically work on side/personal projects to gain real world experience. However, an often under-emphasized aspect of the real world experience that students seek to build through projects is working within a team; these projects tend to have a single developer: the student, effectively limiting both the kind of real world development experience the student gains and the scope of the project. And though many join clubs and on-campus organizations to have that experience on working within a team, it can still be difficult to find fulfilling or interesting work.

**Solution: pickup-teams**  
Pickup Teams, abbreviated as PUT (like the CRUD operation), is a website designed to connect students looking to work on similar personal projects. The design of PUT has yet to be fleshed out in full and is expected to change, but the fundamental idea is that students can post their own personal projects or ideas that they'd like to build out with a team (such as on a job board), view other students' projects and ideas, and connect with those other students whose projects and ideas they find interesting.

### Functionality
**Potential Users**  
+ students looking to build out their own projects
+ students looking to work within a team setting

+ post about my project on the site
+ connect with people who're interested in my project
+ connect with people whose projects/ideas I find interesting
+ form a team
+ leave comments under a post
+ find a poster's contact info
+ have a profile where I can list my contact info and skills, and find others' profiles
+ control how much of my personal information I put up
+ bookmark projects I find interesting and follow others whose ideas I find interesting
+ search by keyword and filter for projects and ideas
+ see the details of a post

### Technical Specifications
